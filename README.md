# Frontend

This is my default frontend using react with redux. This connects well with my backend.

## How to run

Running this should be a pretty straight forward and easy.

1. Download code from Github

2. npm install

3. npm start

## What it does

Currently the project runs a register command that will create a customer. The security it is using is JWT authentication. From here you can create web api endpoints and set up either to open or locked down to logged in people and further lock them down by their role. 

Enjoy!
